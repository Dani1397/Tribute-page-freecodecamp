            Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809 â€“ October 7, 1849) was an American writer, poet,
            editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of
            mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and
            of American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short
            story. He is also generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited
            with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction.[1] Poe was the first well-known American writer
            to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.[2]

            Poe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as cosmology
            and cryptography. He and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and
            television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The Mystery Writers of America present an
            annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.
